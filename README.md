## About

boba is a Go library for building TUI form based on [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles). This project is still in the early stages of development and is not recommended for production use.

It is inspired by [huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) which is also a Go library for building TUI form created by the same authors of bubbletea and bubbles.
Please check out their project if you are looking for a more stable and feature-complete solution.
